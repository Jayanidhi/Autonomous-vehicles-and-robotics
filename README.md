Autonomous vehicles and robotics:

Autonomous vehicles and robotics are closely related fields within engineering and computer science that focus on creating machines capable of performing tasks with minimal or no human intervention.


Features: Autonomous vehicles

•	Sensor-based perception (LiDAR, cameras, radar)

•	BGPS and SLAM for localization

•	Route planning and obstacle avoidance

•	Real-time decision-making

•	Vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication

•	Safety and redundancy systems

•	Levels of autonomy (SAE 0–5)



 Features : Robotics

•	Sensors and actuators for interaction

•	Control systems for movement and precision

•	Mobility (wheeled, legged, aerial)

•	Autonomy and AI integration

•	Human-robot interaction (HRI)

•	Task-specific functionality

•	Learning and adaptability



Frontend:

•	Dashboards: Display status, sensor data, maps.

•	Controls: Manual override, test input, simulation control.

•	Visualization: 2D/3D views of environment and robot state.



Backend :

•	Processes sensor data (LiDAR, cameras, GPS)

•	Performs perception, localization, and mapping

•	Handles path planning and motion control

•	Runs AI models for detection and decision-making

•	Manages system communication and hardware control

•	Stores and logs data for analysis and debugging

Simulation & Testing:

•	Simulation Platforms: Gazebo, CARLA, Webots, V-REP

•	Digital Twins: NVIDIA Omniverse, Unity Robotics

•	Testing & Debugging: RViz, Foxglove Studio, rqt, simulators

Usage

•	Transport: Self-driving cars, autonomous trucks, and delivery robots.

•	Warehousing: Robots for picking, sorting, and inventory management.

•	Agriculture: Drones and smart tractors for planting, spraying, and monitoring.

•	Healthcare: Robotic assistants for delivery, cleaning, and patient care.

•	Defense: Drones and unmanned vehicles for surveillance and bomb disposal.

•	Construction/Mining: Automated machinery for digging and material transport.
